				<p class="intro"> <span class="location"> Staten Island, New York — </span> Staten Islanders may have more to worry about than tolls when congestion pricing starts. 
				</p>
				 <p>
					“Congestion pricing is going to be bad for Staten Island, not just on the economic front, but also on the environmental front as well–their own environmental impact study shows that pollution rates are going to get worse,” said Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, D-23rd District, NY.
				</p>
				<p>
					Set to impose a $9 toll for driving into Manhattan’s core next month, the policy has sparked frustration among car-dependant Staten Islanders. The MTA’s Central Business District Tolling Program (CBDTP) Final Environmental Assessment predicts increased borough pollution, which will likely disproportionately affect lower-income areas, raising significant equity and environmental concerns amongst the Staten Island community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the MTA’s report, first published in May 2023 and updated in June 2024, asserts that congestion pricing will have "no significant impact on the human or natural environment," a closer examination suggests a more complex reality for Staten Islanders.
				</p>

				<h3>The pollution problem</h3>
				<p>
					Congestion pricing aims to shift travel habits toward public transit, targeting a threefold goal of raising funds, easing traffic, and cutting pollution. But these changes could trigger unintended consequences, such as rerouting traffic through less equipped neighborhoods.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cliff Hagen, a Staten Island environmentalist, former President of Protectors of Pine Oak Woods, Community District 3 board member, and a litigant in the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) federal lawsuit against the MTA, U.S. Department of Transportation, and other related entities, argues that the policy won’t stop residents from driving.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Even if people do drive to get on a bus or onto the Staten Island rapid transit or drive up to the Staten Island Ferry, they're still driving, but now they're driving in our community,” said Hagen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Redirecting traffic to Staten Island transit hubs reduces congestion in Manhattan but increases it locally, such as in areas surrounding the St. George Ferry terminal, where nearby residents earn an average of $34,000 to $47,000 annually, according to the 2022 American Community Survey.

					“We're prioritizing wealthy New Yorkers over more working-class New Yorkers, which I have a big problem with,” said Scarcella-Spanton, who represents Port Richmond, Grasmere, and Tompkinsville, all neighborhoods surrounding the ferry and is also a litigant in the UFT lawsuit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MTA’s report found that “Bronx, Richmond (Staten Island), Nassau, and Bergen Counties saw increases in all pollutants with the project.” Staten Island is projected to see rises in daily vehicle-miles traveled and emissions of formaldehyde, benzene, and other pollutants.
				</p>

					Alexander Heil, Columbia Adjunct Lecturer and former Chief Economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, emphasized that although effects should not be ignored, they are inevitable.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Not having the program is not eliminating these emissions either, someone will bear the burden—it's just a question of distribution," said Heil.
				</p>
<h3>'It’s Not about Winners or Losers'</h3>
				<p>
					The $9 toll is expected to generate significant revenue, around $15 billion, funding citywide improvements like accessible subway stations, upgraded signals, and newer train cars.
				</p>
				<p>
					MTA data reveals that while 64% of Staten Islanders commute to work, over 20% rely on public transit—a significant portion of the population—highlighting that a significant amount of Staten Islanders will reap benefits from public transportation fixes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Brian Fritsch, Associate Director at the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA, highlights the broader gains of congestion pricing, saying it's not about picking winners or losers.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Virtually all areas of the city, with just a couple of exceptions, are going to see traffic reductions as part of this plan, which is a win for almost everyone,” said Fritsch.
				</p>
				<p>
					To support communities facing increased truck traffic and pollution, the MTA has allocated $100 million for mitigation, including cleaner refrigeration units, an asthma center in the Bronx, and electric truck charging stations. Thirteen communities, including Mott Haven, Northeast Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn, and Newark, are set to benefit. Notably, Staten Island was not included.
				</p>

				<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
				<p>
					Staten Islanders are demanding greater transparency in MTA spending and an audit of how the funds will be used. Calls have also been made to address fare evasion, which cost the MTA $700 million in 2022 alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					“One of my colleagues carries legislation to audit the MTA, so that's something I'm going to look into picking up for next year as well, because we should know how they're spending our money–this is a lot of money,” said Scarcella-Spanton.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although legal challenges persist, including lawsuits such as the UFT one, the policy appears likely to move forward. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end congestion pricing, but its future remains uncertain.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ultimate question is whether the toll will be high enough to generate the revenue needed for promised transit improvements.
				</p>
				<p>
					“My biggest concern is that we’ll end up with a congestion pricing system that charges too little,” said Heil. “We’ll have frustrated people, but still not enough money to fund transit upgrades.”
